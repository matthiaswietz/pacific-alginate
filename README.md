# Bacterial community dynamics during alginate degradation in the South, Equatorial, and North Pacific Ocean

This repo describes the bioinformatic workflow for the manuscript "Distinct bacterial succession and functional response to alginate in the South, Equatorial, and North Pacific Ocean" by Balmonte et al. (doi XXX). Here, we investigated alginate-induced  compositional and functional shifts of particle-associated and free-living bacterial communities in the South Subtropical, Equatorial, and Polar Frontal North Pacific. Samples originate from mesocosm experimetns run onboard expedition SO248 (BacGeoPac) with RV Sonne. Data includes DNA- and RNA-based reads processed into amplicon sequence variants using DADA2. 

The repo contains:

- [DADA2 workflow](./SO248_Alg_DADA2.Rmd)
- Resulting [ASV](./SO248_Alg_seqtab.txt) and [taxonomy](./SO248_Alg_tax.txt) tables
- [ASV sequences](./SO248_Alg_seqtab.txt)
- Script for formatting raw sequence tables
- plotting and analysis scripts
